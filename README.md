# todo-list-yt
This C++ program is a console-based To-Do List Application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently through a simple text-based interface. The application enables users to add new tasks, view their current list of tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks they no longer need. A key feature of this program is its persistent storage functionality: all tasks are automatically saved to a file (tasks.txt) when modified and reloaded when the program restarts, ensuring that the user's data is not lost between sessions. The interface is user-friendly, with a clear menu system and visual indicators (such as [X] for completed and [ ] for pending tasks) that make it easy to track progress. This project demonstrates practical use of fundamental programming concepts like file handling, data structures (vectors), and control flow, resulting in a functional and reliable tool for personal task management.
